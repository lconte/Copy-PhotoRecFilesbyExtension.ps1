.SYNOPSIS
Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension copies all files from the PhotoRec folders to new folders named by file extension.
.DESCRIPTION
Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension uses the file extensions to create folders and then copy in the folder all the files founds with the same extension.
If a file with the same name is found in another folder it's renamed adding (1)...(2) and so on and then copied, to keep all the versions as default.
To keep only one version set the parameter OverWriteDuplicated to $True.
IMPORTANT: *** THIS SCRIPT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ***
.PARAMETER RootPhotoRec
The Root folder used by PhotoRec to store recovered files
.PARAMETER RootDestFolder
The Root folder where new folders and files will be created and copied.
.PARAMETER OverWriteDuplicated
To Overwrite any recurring file with the same name in the same destination folder. Only the last copied is keep.
By default OverWriteDuplicated is set to False.
.PARAMETER CustomFileFilter
Is possible to set a filter to reorganize only a type of file. The filter must start with a * such as *jpg
.EXAMPLE
.\Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension.ps1 -RootPhotoRec G:\PhotoRec\* -RootDestFolder H:\PhotoOrderedbyExtension
.EXAMPLE
.\Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension.ps1 -RootPhotoRec G:\PhotoRec\* -RootDestFolder H:\PhotoOrderedbyExtension -OverWriteDuplicated $True

Any file found in the destination folder with the same name is overwritten
.EXAMPLE
.\Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension.ps1 -RootPhotoRec G:\PhotoRec\* -RootDestFolder H:\PhotoOrderedbyExtension -CustomFileFilter *mp3

In this example only MP3 files will be copied from the source folder to the destination. By default any file type is copied and reorganized.
.EXAMPLE
.\Copy-PhotoRecFilesbyExtension.ps1 -RootPhotoRec G:\PhotoRec\* -RootDestFolder H:\PhotoOrderedbyExtension -CustomFileFilter "*mp4","*avi"

In this example only MP4 and AVI files will be copied from the source folder to the destination. Enclose with double quote and separate with a comma any extension required; don't forget the *.
